  %strong Percent Body Fat
  %br
  The standard percent body fat (PBF) is 15% for males and 23% for females, which are respective midpoints of the standard ranges of Body Fat
  Mass in relation to standard weight: 10-20% of the standard weight for males and 18-28% for females. An individual with a calculated PBF that
  is greater than the standard range is regarded as having a high level of body fat. When an individual's PBF is below the standard range, they
  are regarded as having a low level of body fat. Individuals with low levels of body fat can be separated into two categories. The first has
  muscle mass that is deemed an appropriate amount for that individual's body composition. The second type has an inadequate amount of muscle
  mass in relation to their body composition. These individuals can be considered to be in an unhealthy state due to their imbalance of Body
  Fat Mass and Lean Body Mass, and these individuals have a higher possibility of contracting clinical diseases.
%p
  %strong Body Fat Mass
  %br
  Body Fat Mass indicates the total quantity of lipids that can be extracted from fat and all other cells. Skin fold measures do not directly 
  measure Body Fat Mass, but is determined by inserting the measures into a body density formula. Body Fat Mass is found stored under the skin,
  in visceral areas, and between muscles. When an individual's fat mass is higher than the standard range, he/she is diagnosed as being obese.
  Monitoring the amount of body fat mass an individual has is critical to maintaining good health.
%p
  %strong Lean Body Mass
  %br
  Lean Body Mass refers to the entire body weight with the exception of Body Fat Mass. Your body composition assessment provides both the
  fundamentals as well as the comprehensive data related to Lean Body Mass that can aid in the evaluation of the health status of the examinee.
  As reference, athletic body types will have a higher proportion of Lean Body Mass compared to normal body types. As such, it is important for
  all body types alike to monitor their Lean Body Mass.

  Body Mass Index (BMI) is an index used to determine obesity by using height and weight. The BMI method has been widely relied on in general
  medicine, dietary, and sports medicine fields as the main means of diagnosing obesity. However, this method is flawed in that it cannot be
  applied to adults with high levels of Lean Body Mass, children, those over the age of 65, or pregnant females. Nevertheless, as BMI has been
  the most commonly used index, research using the BMI method to prevent adult diseases has been conducted frequently.

  The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) indicates the minimum energy required to sustain vital functions while at rest. We use the Katch-McArdle formula
  to determine the BMR using a known regression equation based on the amount of Lean Body Mass (LBM) an individual has. LBM is known to be
  closely related to BMR. BMR is usually calculated using indirect Calorimetry, which measures oxygen demand. However, we calculate BMR using
  LBM. Therefore, should the examinee gain LBM during the weight management program, their BMR would also increase, which is a desirable result in
  any weight management program.

  %strong Visceral Fat Area
  %br
  Visceral Fat is the fat surrounding your major organs. The Waist and Waist-to-hip Ratio measures provide an output of the amount of visceral fat area an
  examinee has. Because of the location of visceral fat, the amount of visceral fat the examinee has is associated with the risk of developing certain health
  diseases. An accumulation of visceral fat can contribute to increased risk of Insulin-Resistant Diabetes, Heart Disease, Stroke, and even Dementia. The
  accumulation of visceral fat has also been associated with technical difficulties in performing surgery, specifically abdominal surgery. Therefore, it is
  important to monitor the examinee's visceral fat levels provided by these measurements in order to properly assess that individual's current chances of
  developing the mentioned health risks.
